   In recent years I have heard of “scientific experiments” conducted
by the late Dr. Charcot and a coterie of medical men, upon the
patients of the Salpêtrière. When I have read of these, I have thought
of that paralyzed woman with dread lest she might be yet alive to
suffer; and with indignation against the Science which counts cases
like these of uttermost human affliction, “interesting” subjects for
investigation!
   Some years after this time, hearing of the great Asylum designed
by Mr. Holloway, I made an effort to bring influence from many
quarters to bear on him to induce him to change its destination at
that early stage, and make it the much-needed Home for Incurables.
Many ladies and gentlemen whose names I hoped would carry
weight with him, were kindly willing to write to him on the subject.
Among them was the Hon. Mrs. Monsell, then Lady Superior of
Clewer. Her letter to me on the subject was so wise that I have
preserved it. Mr. Holloway, however, was inexorable. Would to
Heaven that some other millionaire, instead of spending tens of
thousands on Palaces of Delight and places of public amusement,
would take to heart the case of those most wretched of human
beings, the Destitute Incurables, who are still sent every year by
thousands to die in the workhouses of England and Ireland with
scarcely one of the comforts which their miserable condition
demands.
